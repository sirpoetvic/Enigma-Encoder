The code should theoretically work.
Changes have been made to make the positions of the rotors be static, so that accessing individual 
rotors is unnecessary. This allows for easy resets of the program, in which putting those values to 0 
and clearing the selectedRotors arrayList would be all to reset.

Implement an option to keep going while the user wants to continue.


//increment rotor 2 if rotor 1 goes 1 full revolution and keeps rotor 1 position under 26
        if(rONECount > 26) {
            rTWOCount++;
            rONECount %= 26;
        }

        //increment rotor 3 if rotor 2 goes 1 full revolution keeps rotor 2 position under 26
        if(rTWOCount > 26) {
            rTHREECount++;
            rTWOCount %= 26;
        }

        //keeps rotor 3 position under 26
        if(rTHREECount > 26)
            rTHREECount %= 26;
